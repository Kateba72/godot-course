# godot-course
Repository to share our progress in the godot course.

## How to use this

Install git - google something for your operating system if you don't know how. Open a terminal and use these commands in your project folder.

    git init
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Kateba72/godot-course.git
    git pull origin master
    git checkout -b your-name
    
    # use this to be able to only use git push in the future. You might need a GitHub account for it
    git push --set-upstream origin your-name
    
You now have the repository connected and working.

To share your current status, use `git commit -a` and enter a message describing your recent changes to commit your changes locally,
after that, use `git push` to publish them.
